<h2>Laravel API Frontend</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
The laravel-api-frontend repository is a project that demonstrates the integration of a Laravel backend with a Vue.js frontend. It serves as a foundational template for developers aiming to build modern web applications with a decoupled architecture, leveraging Laravel's robust backend capabilities alongside Vue.js for dynamic user interfaces.</p>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>
<p>The repository is organized into two primary directories:</p>
<u>
<li><strong>backend/:</strong> Contains the Laravel API backend, responsible for handling business logic, database interactions, and serving data via API endpoints.</li>

<li><strong>frontend_vue/:</strong> Houses the Vue.js frontend application, which communicates with the Laravel API to display data and handle user interactions.</li></u>



<h3>Features</h3>
<u><li><strong>Laravel Backend:</strong> Utilizes Laravel's features such as routing, controllers, and Eloquent ORM to manage data and business logic.</li>

<li><strong>Vue.js Frontend:</strong> Implements Vue.js components to create a responsive and interactive user interface.</li>

<li><strong>API Communication:</strong> The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API endpoints, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and scalability.</li></u>

<br>
<p>The backend will be accessible at <strong>http://localhost:8000</strong>, and the frontend at <strong>http://localhost:5173</strong>.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>Once both servers are running, you can access the application by navigating to the frontend URL in your browser. The Vue.js frontend will interact with the Laravel API backend to fetch and display data.</p>
